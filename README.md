This chapter contains the basics of Python, such as Data handling. 
<br/>It is crucial to improve your basic knowledge of data handling.
<br/> This repository provides knowledge in three sections:
<br/> **Basic** 
<br/> **Numpy**
<br/> **Pandas**
<br/>
<br/>In the following parts, Matplotlib and Seaborn will be addressed because it is much easier to learn from the machine learning example.
<br/>
<br/>**Disclosure** 
<br/>This work is based on the textbook "The Perfect Guide for Machine Learning with Python" written by Chulmin Kwon 
<br/> (I hope this is the correct spelling ðŸ˜…).
